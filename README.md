In this lab, I completed a full pipeline for image classification using Fashion MNIST. I began with dataset exploration, examining size, distribution, and preprocessing needs like normalization and reshaping. I then implemented a baseline fully connected network to establish a performance reference. Next, I designed a custom CNN architecture from scratch, justifying choices for layers, kernel sizes, and activation functions. I conducted controlled experiments on convolutional depth, comparing 1, 2, and 3-layer networks, and analyzed their performance trade-offs. After training and evaluating all models, I interpreted the results, explaining why CNNs outperform dense networks, what inductive biases they introduce, and when convolutional approaches are not suitable.
